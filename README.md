# Node Pseudo NAS
This is sort of like a NAS (network attached storage) except with a nice web interface. It's meant to be run on a computer with an external drive attached.

It's mostly for streaming videos, but you can use it for whatever.

The stylesheet is minified and included in the header of each response, and the favicon is encoded as a base64 data URI in the HTML. So the only file actually necessary to run it is node-pseudo-nas.js
